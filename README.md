🌍 Introduction 
Welcome to my language learning website! I designed and developed this project entirely from scratch, a true reflection of my passion for web development and creating interactive learning experiences. 💻✨ 
The project is still a work in progress, some buttons and features are yet to be activated. But i’m constantly improving it to deliver a smoother user experience and introduce exciting new features in the next version. 🚀 
🛠️ Tech Stack Here’s what powers the website: 
HTML5 – for structure and semantic foundation 📄 
CSS3 – for styling and responsive design 🎨 
React.js – for building dynamic and reusable UI components ⚛️ 
Bootstrap 5 – for consistent layout and responsiveness 🖥️ 
Plus, I integrated some cool libraries and packages to make the experience even better: 
animate.css – for smooth animations and transitions ✨ 
react-icons – for clean, scalable icons 🎯 
react-router-dom – for seamless client-side routing 🔀 🚀
